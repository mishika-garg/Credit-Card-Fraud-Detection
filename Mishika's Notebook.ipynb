    "## Credit Card Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, credit card fraud has caused significant financial losses worldwide, with an estimated $28.58 billion reported in 2020 (Nilson, 2021\n",
    "). Seeing the growing impact of fraudulent activity on both customers and businesses, I decided to work on this project to better understand how data can be used to detect and prevent such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "My project applies feature engineering techniques to raw credit card transaction data to uncover patterns that may indicate fraud. By creating new, more insightful variables from existing data, such as customer age, transaction distance, and domestic versus international activity, I aimed to make the dataset more informative and improve the ability of predictive models to flag suspicious transactions. This project reflects my interest in using data-driven approaches to solve real-world financial problems and enhance customer trust."

In my project, I focused on analyzing each customer’s spending behavior over time to detect unusual activity patterns. For instance, if a customer suddenly increases the frequency or value of their transactions, it could suggest that their card information has been compromised.\n",

(2011), I engineered several historical features that capture variations in transaction behavior, such as spending trends and merchant interactions. These features help provide additional context to each transaction and improve the reliability of fraud detection. Some of these calculations require unique merchant and category identifiers, so the steps can be adjusted or skipped depending on the available data."
